# E-Commerce Microservices Project

## üåü Overview
This project is a modern e-commerce platform built using a microservices architecture. It demonstrates the implementation of various microservices patterns and best practices, providing a scalable and maintainable solution for e-commerce operations.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The system is composed of multiple microservices, each responsible for specific business capabilities:

- **Customer Service**: Manages customer data and authentication
- **Product Service**: Handles product catalog and inventory
- **Order Service**: Processes and manages orders
- **Payment Service**: Handles payment processing
- **Notification Service**: Manages communication with users
- **Gateway Service**: API Gateway for routing and load balancing
- **Config Server**: Centralized configuration management
- **Discovery Service**: Service registration and discovery

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

### Core Technologies
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for creating microservices
- **Spring Cloud**: For cloud-native application development
- **Spring Security**: Authentication and authorization
- **Spring Data JPA**: Data persistence
- **Spring Cloud Gateway**: API Gateway implementation

### Databases
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary relational database
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for specific services
- **PgAdmin & Mongo Express**: Database management tools

### Message Broker
- **Apache Kafka**: Event-driven communication between services
- **Zookeeper**: Distributed configuration and synchronization

### Security & Authentication
- **Keycloak**: Identity and access management
- **JWT**: Token-based authentication

### Monitoring & Tracing
- **Zipkin**: Distributed tracing system
- **Spring Actuator**: Application monitoring and metrics

### Development Tools
- **Docker**: Containerization
- **Docker Compose**: Container orchestration
- **MailDev**: Email testing service

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Java 17 or higher
- Maven

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Start the infrastructure services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. The following services will be available:
- PostgreSQL: localhost:5432
- PgAdmin: localhost:5050
- MongoDB: localhost:27017
- Mongo Express: localhost:8081
- Kafka: localhost:9092
- Zipkin: localhost:9411
- Keycloak: localhost:9098
- MailDev: localhost:1080 (UI), localhost:1025 (SMTP)

## üîå Service Ports
- Gateway Service: 8080
- Config Server: 8888
- Discovery Service: 8761
- Customer Service: 8081
- Product Service: 8082
- Order Service: 8083
- Payment Service: 8084
- Notification Service: 8085

## üåê Network Architecture
All services communicate through a dedicated Docker network (`microservices-net`) and are discoverable via the service registry.

## üìä Data Flow
1. Requests come through the API Gateway
2. Gateway authenticates requests using Keycloak
3. Requests are routed to appropriate microservices
4. Services communicate through both REST and event-driven patterns (Kafka)
5. Distributed tracing is handled by Zipkin

## üîê Security
- Keycloak handles authentication and authorization
- API Gateway secures all incoming requests
- Inter-service communication is secured
- Sensitive data is encrypted

## üìù Logging and Monitoring
- Centralized logging system
- Distributed tracing with Zipkin
- Health checks via Spring Actuator
- Performance metrics collection
